## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on Data Visualization 

## Directions
1. Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A05_DataVisualization.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure your code is tidy; use line breaks to ensure your code fits in the knitted output.
5. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
6. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.

## Set up your session 

1. Set up your session. Load the tidyverse, lubridate, here & cowplot packages, and verify your home directory. Read in the NTL-LTER processed data files for nutrients and chemistry/physics for Peter and Paul Lakes (use the tidy `NTL-LTER_Lake_Chemistry_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv` version in the Processed_KEY folder) and the processed data file for the Niwot Ridge litter dataset (use the `NEON_NIWO_Litter_mass_trap_Processed.csv` version, again from the Processed_KEY folder). 

2. Make sure R is reading dates as date format; if not change the format to date.

```{r initialize project}
#1 
#load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(cowplot)

#verify directory
getwd()

#read files
NTL <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Lake_Chemistry_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv", 
                stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
NIWO <- read.csv("./Data/Processed/NEON_NIWO_Litter_mass_trap_Processed.csv", 
                 stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#2 
NTL$sampledate <- as.Date(NTL$sampledate)
NIWO$collectDate <- as.Date(NIWO$collectDate)

```
## Define your theme
3. Build a theme and set it as your default theme. Customize the look of at least two of the following: 
 * Plot background
 * Plot title
 * Axis labels
 * Axis ticks/gridlines
 * Legend

```{r build plot theme}
#3
theme <- theme_light() +
  theme(
    axis.text = element_text(color = "black"),
    legend.position = "top"
  )

```

## Create graphs
For numbers 4-7, create ggplot graphs and adjust aesthetics to follow best practices for data visualization. Ensure your theme, color palettes, axes, and additional aesthetics are edited accordingly.

4. [NTL-LTER] Plot total phosphorus (`tp_ug`) by phosphate (`po4`), with separate aesthetics for Peter and Paul lakes. Add line(s) of best fit using the `lm` method. Adjust your axes to hide extreme values (hint: change the limits using `xlim()` and/or `ylim()`).

```{r plot total P vs PO4}
#4 
tp_ugplot <- 
  ggplot(NTL, aes(x = po4, y = tp_ug, color = lakename)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  xlim(0, 45) +
  ylim(0, 150) +
  theme
  
print(tp_ugplot)
  
```


5. [NTL-LTER] Make three separate boxplots of (a) temperature, (b) TP, and (c) TN, with month as the x axis and lake as a color aesthetic. Then, create a cowplot that combines the three graphs. Make sure that only one legend is present and that graph axes are aligned. 

Tips:
* Recall the discussion on factors in the lab section as it may be helpful here. 
* Setting an axis title in your theme to `element_blank()` removes the axis title (useful when multiple, aligned plots use the same axis values)
* Setting a legend's position to "none" will remove the legend from a plot.
* Individual plots can have different sizes when combined using `cowplot`.

```{r Create boxplots}
#5 
aplot <- 
  ggplot(NTL, aes(x = month, y = temperature_C, color = lakename)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
              legend.position = "none")

bplot <-
  ggplot(NTL, aes(x = month, y = tp_ug, color = lakename)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
              legend.position = "none")

cplot <-
  ggplot(NTL, aes(x = month, y = tn_ug, color = lakename)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
              legend.position = "none")

allplot <- plot_grid(aplot, bplot, cplot, nrow = 3, align = 'h', rel_heights = c(0.7, 1, 1))
print(allplot)

```

Question: What do you observe about the variables of interest over seasons and between lakes? 

> Answer: Peter Lake tends to have greater amount of nutrients than Paul Lake, and Peter Lake is more active in dates later than Paul Lake.

6. [Niwot Ridge] Plot a subset of the litter dataset by displaying only the "Needles" functional group. Plot the dry mass of needle litter by date and separate by NLCD class with a color aesthetic. (no need to adjust the name of each land use)

7. [Niwot Ridge] Now, plot the same plot but with NLCD classes separated into three facets rather than separated by color. 

```{r Plot litter}
#6
Niwot1 <- 
  ggplot(subset(NIWO, functionalGroup == "Needles"), 
         aes(x = collectDate, y = dryMass, color = nlcdClass)) +
  geom_point()
print(Niwot1)

#7
Niwot2 <- 
  ggplot(subset(NIWO, functionalGroup == "Needles"), 
         aes(x = collectDate, y = dryMass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(nlcdClass), nrow = 3)
print(Niwot2)

```
Question: Which of these plots (6 vs. 7) do you think is more effective, and why? 

> Answer: I think plot 7 is mor effective because it separates the data based on additional layer. It shows the distribution by year and by nlcdClass whereas plot 6 crumples up all three nlcdClass together.
